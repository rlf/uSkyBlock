# ======================================================================================================================
#
# Here follows the format and explanation for the challenge group and challenges setup. The single commented (#) are the
# most used settings while the double commented (##) are optional if you like to use those settings.
#
# Item type format
# Item types are defined as in the minecraft /give command, i.e. with their minecraft key and possible components in
# square brackets. For example, 'minecraft:diamond_sword[damage=42]'. Refer to the Minecraft wiki for more information:
# https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format. You can also use the command '/usb iteminfo' to get the information.
#
# This item type is supplemented with additional information depending on where it is used:
#
# display-item: <type>
# An item to be displayed in a GUI. It only defines the item type as above, without any additional information.
# For example: 'cobblestone', 'minecraft:stone', 'diamond_sword[damage=42]'.
#
# item-requirement: <type>:<amount>[;+<increment>]
# An item requirement for a challenge. The amount is the number of items required. The optional +<amount> is the number
# of items to add to the required amount for each repeat of the challenge. For example, 'cobblestone:64;+16' would
# require 64 cobblestone for the first completion and 80 cobblestone for the second completion. Other options are
# -, *, and / for subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For example, 'cobblestone:64;*2' would
# require 64 cobblestone for the first completion, 128 cobblestone for the second completion, and 256 cobblestone for
# the third completion.
#
# item-reward: [{p=<probability>}]<type>:<amount>
# An item reward for a challenge. The amount is the number of items to give. The optional {p=<probability>} is the
# probability of the item being given. For example, 'cobblestone:64' would give 64 cobblestone every time the challenge
# is completed, while '{p=0.1}cobblestone:64' would give 64 cobblestone 10% of the time.
#
# ======================================================================================================================

#                  the next rank. A rankLeeway of 0 would require them all.
