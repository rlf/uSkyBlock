# ======================================================================================================================
#
# Here follows the format and explanation for the challenge group and challenges setup. The single commented (#) are the
# most used settings while the double commented (##) are optional if you like to use those settings.
#
# Item type format
# Item types are defined as in the minecraft /give command, i.e. with their minecraft key and possible components in
# square brackets. For example, 'minecraft:diamond_sword[damage=42]'. Refer to the Minecraft wiki for more information:
# https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format. You can also use the command '/usb iteminfo' to get the information.
#
# This item type is supplemented with additional information depending on where it is used:
#
# display-item: <type>
# An item to be displayed in a GUI. It only defines the item type as above, without any additional information.
# For example: 'cobblestone', 'minecraft:stone', 'diamond_sword[damage=42]'.
#
# item-requirement: <type>:<amount>[;+<increment>]
# An item requirement for a challenge. The amount is the number of items required. The optional +<amount> is the number
# of items to add to the required amount for each repeat of the challenge. For example, 'cobblestone:64;+16' would
# require 64 cobblestone for the first completion and 80 cobblestone for the second completion. Other options are
# -, *, and / for subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For example, 'cobblestone:64;*2' would
# require 64 cobblestone for the first completion, 128 cobblestone for the second completion, and 256 cobblestone for
# the third completion.
#
# item-reward: [{p=<probability>}]<type>:<amount>
# An item reward for a challenge. The amount is the number of items to give. The optional {p=<probability>} is the
# probability of the item being given. For example, 'cobblestone:64' would give 64 cobblestone every time the challenge
# is completed, while '{p=0.1}cobblestone:64' would give 64 cobblestone 10% of the time.
#
# ======================================================================================================================
# All challenges are defined in the ranks section. Each rank is a tier of challenges that players can complete.
#
# ranks:
#  # [text] name of the challenge Rank.
#  TierX:
#    # [text] The name of the challenge rank that shows when you do /challenges (supports capitals and color codes).
#    name: '&aCustom Challenges rank name'
#    # [display-item] The item to be displayed in the challenge menu for completed challenges.
#    displayItem: 'cyan_terracotta'
#    # [integer] The time in hours before required items reset to default (this overwrites the main reset time)
#    resetInHours: 20
#    # These requirements controls when a challenge group will be available to a player.
#    requires:
#      # [integer] The number of tasks per rank that can be left uncompleted to advance to the next rank. For example,
#                  if you have 4 challenges with a rankLeeway of 1, a player would only need to complete 3 to advance to
#                  the next rank. A rankLeeway of 0 would require them all.
#      rankLeeway: 8
#      # [List[text]] Challenges that have to be completed before this group will available to a player.
#      challenges:
#      - a challenge name

#        # player must use /island level first to update their level.
#        type: onPlayer
#        ## type: islandLevel
#        ## type: onIsland

#        ## radius: 20

#        requiredItems:
#        - stone:64;+16

#        # [true/false] If the challenge can be repeated or not.
#        ## repeatable: true
#        # [integer] The maximum number of times the challenge can be completed. Overrides the default repeatLimit.

#          # [List[item-requirement]] A list of items given to the player for completing the challenge.

#                         as OP or from the Console. Examples:

#          ## - 'console: give {party} aweseomestuff 32'
#        # reward section to reward the player for completing a repeated challenge (any time after the first). The
#        # structure is identical to the 'reward' section.
